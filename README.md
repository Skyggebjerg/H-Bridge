# H-Bridge
Hbridge Unit is a highly efficient DC motor drive module designed to provide reliable motor control functionality. It incorporates the "STM32F030+RZ7899" scheme, enabling precise control of DC motors. The module communicates with the M5 host via I2C, allowing for PWM control of motor speed as well as forward, backward, and braking functions.

Equipped with robust protection features, the Hbridge Unit ensures the safe operation of the motor. It includes over-current, over-voltage, and over-temperature protection functions, providing a reliable and secure drive solution.

The module is designed with versatility in mind and includes 6-12V and 5V switching circuits, accommodating the input power requirements of different motors. This flexibility makes the Hbridge Unit suitable for a wide range of applications, including robotics, motor drives, industrial automation, and smart home systems.

Features:

Overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature protection, Power switching, 

I2C address: Default 0x20
